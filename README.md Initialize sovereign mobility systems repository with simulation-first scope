# sovereign-mobility-systems
Industrial-grade autonomous mobility, energy-aware infrastructure, and sovereign transportation design. Simulation-first. Terrain-first. Infrastructure-aligned.
This repository focuses on:
- Terrain-first autonomy (not lane-following toys)
- Industrial, emergency, and sovereign use cases
- Energy-aware mobility systems
- Simulation-first development (no unsafe deployment claims)
https://github.com/
This is **not** a consumer vehicle project.
This is **infrastructure-scale mobility**.

## Scope

- Industrial autonomy (agriculture, mining, logistics)
- Emergency & priority transport (ambulance, fire, disaster response)
- Terrain-adaptive motion (uneven roads, drains, speed bumps)
- Energy-aware systems (waste heat, wireless transfer — where physically valid)
- Simulation-only research for non-deployable concepts

## Repository Structure


---

## Development Philosophy

- Simulation before hardware
- Physics-respecting architecture
- Clear separation between deployable systems and research concepts
- No unsafe claims
- No consumer-market compromises

---

## Status

This repository is under active construction.
Files are added incrementally and may mutate as systems converge.

## Conceptual Context

This repository exists within a broader exploration of sovereign infrastructure,
industrial autonomy, and post-consumer mobility systems.

High-level philosophical and economic concepts are documented separately
and do not represent deployable claims within this repository.
